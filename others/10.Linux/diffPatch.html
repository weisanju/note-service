NAME
       patch - apply a diff file to an original

SYNOPSIS
       patch [options] [originalfile [patchfile]]

       but usually just

       patch -pnum &lt;patchfile

DESCRIPTION
       patch takes a patch file patchfile containing a difference listing
       produced by the diff program and applies those differences to one or more
       original files, producing patched versions.  Normally the patched
       versions are put in place of the originals.  Backups can be made; see the
       -b or --backup option.  The names of the files to be patched are usually
       taken from the patch file, but if there's just one file to be patched it
       can specified on the command line as originalfile.

       Upon startup, patch attempts to determine the type of the diff listing,
       unless overruled by a -c (--context), -e (--ed), -n (--normal), or -u
       (--unified) option.  Context diffs (old-style, new-style, and unified)
       and normal diffs are applied by the patch program itself, while ed diffs
       are simply fed to the ed(1) editor via a pipe.

       patch tries to skip any leading garbage, apply the diff, and then skip
       any trailing garbage.  Thus you could feed an article or message
       containing a diff listing to patch, and it should work.	If the entire
       diff is indented by a consistent amount, or if a context diff contains
       lines ending in CRLF or is encapsulated one or more times by prepending
       &quot;- &quot; to lines starting with &quot;-&quot; as specified by Internet RFC 934, this is
       taken into account.  After removing indenting or encapsulation, lines
       beginning with # are ignored, as they are considered to be comments.

       With context diffs, and to a lesser extent with normal diffs, patch can
       detect when the line numbers mentioned in the patch are incorrect, and
       attempts to find the correct place to apply each hunk of the patch.  As a
       first guess, it takes the line number mentioned for the hunk, plus or
       minus any offset used in applying the previous hunk.  If that is not the
       correct place, patch scans both forwards and backwards for a set of lines
       matching the context given in the hunk.	First patch looks for a place
       where all lines of the context match.  If no such place is found, and
       it's a context diff, and the maximum fuzz factor is set to 1 or more,
       then another scan takes place ignoring the first and last line of
       context.  If that fails, and the maximum fuzz factor is set to 2 or more,
       the first two and last two lines of context are ignored, and another scan
       is made.  (The default maximum fuzz factor is 2.)  If patch cannot find a
       place to install that hunk of the patch, it puts the hunk out to a reject
       file, which normally is the name of the output file plus a .rej suffix,
       or # if .rej would generate a file name that is too long (if even
       appending the single character # makes the file name too long, then #
       replaces the file name's last character).  (The rejected hunk comes out
       in ordinary context diff form regardless of the input patch's form.  If
       the input was a normal diff, many of the contexts are simply null.)  The
       line numbers on the hunks in the reject file may be different than in the
       patch file: they reflect the approximate location patch thinks the failed
       hunks belong in the new file rather than the old one.

       As each hunk is completed, you are told if the hunk failed, and if so
       which line (in the new file) patch thought the hunk should go on.  If the
       hunk is installed at a different line from the line number specified in
       the diff you are told the offset.  A single large offset may indicate
       that a hunk was installed in the wrong place.  You are also told if a
       fuzz factor was used to make the match, in which case you should also be
       slightly suspicious.  If the --verbose option is given, you are also told
       about hunks that match exactly.

       If no original file origfile is specified on the command line, patch
       tries to figure out from the leading garbage what the name of the file to
       edit is, using the following rules.

       First, patch takes an ordered list of candidate file names as follows:

	• If the header is that of a context diff, patch takes the old and new
	  file names in the header.  A name is ignored if it does not have
	  enough slashes to satisfy the -pnum or --strip=num option.  The name
	  /dev/null is also ignored.

	• If there is an Index: line in the leading garbage and if either the
	  old and new names are both absent or if patch is conforming to POSIX,
	  patch takes the name in the Index: line.

	• For the purpose of the following rules, the candidate file names are
	  considered to be in the order (old, new, index), regardless of the
	  order that they appear in the header.

       Then patch selects a file name from the candidate list as follows:

	• If some of the named files exist, patch selects the first name if
	  conforming to POSIX, and the best name otherwise.

	• If patch is not ignoring RCS, ClearCase, Perforce, and SCCS (see the
	  -g num or --get=num option), and no named files exist but an RCS,
	  ClearCase, Perforce, or SCCS master is found, patch selects the first
	  named file with an RCS, ClearCase, Perforce, or SCCS master.

	• If no named files exist, no RCS, ClearCase, Perforce, or SCCS master
	  was found, some names are given, patch is not conforming to POSIX, and
	  the patch appears to create a file, patch selects the best name
	  requiring the creation of the fewest directories.

	• If no file name results from the above heuristics, you are asked for
	  the name of the file to patch, and patch selects that name.

       To determine the best of a nonempty list of file names, patch first takes
       all the names with the fewest path name components; of those, it then
       takes all the names with the shortest basename; of those, it then takes
       all the shortest names; finally, it takes the first remaining name.

       Additionally, if the leading garbage contains a Prereq: line, patch takes
       the first word from the prerequisites line (normally a version number)
       and checks the original file to see if that word can be found.  If not,
       patch asks for confirmation before proceeding.

       The upshot of all this is that you should be able to say, while in a news
       interface, something like the following:

	  | patch -d /usr/src/local/blurfl

       and patch a file in the blurfl directory directly from the article
       containing the patch.

       If the patch file contains more than one patch, patch tries to apply each
       of them as if they came from separate patch files.  This means, among
       other things, that it is assumed that the name of the file to patch must
       be determined for each diff listing, and that the garbage before each
       diff listing contains interesting things such as file names and revision
       level, as mentioned previously.

OPTIONS
       -b  or  --backup
	  Make backup files.  That is, when patching a file, rename or copy the
	  original instead of removing it.  When backing up a file that does not
	  exist, an empty, unreadable backup file is created as a placeholder to
	  represent the nonexistent file.  See the -V or --version-control
	  option for details about how backup file names are determined.

       --backup-if-mismatch
	  Back up a file if the patch does not match the file exactly and if
	  backups are not otherwise requested.	This is the default unless patch
	  is conforming to POSIX.

       --no-backup-if-mismatch
	  Do not back up a file if the patch does not match the file exactly and
	  if backups are not otherwise requested.  This is the default if patch
	  is conforming to POSIX.

       -B pref	or  --prefix=pref
	  Prefix pref to a file name when generating its simple backup file
	  name.  For example, with -B /junk/ the simple backup file name for
	  src/patch/util.c is /junk/src/patch/util.c.

       --binary
	  Read and write all files in binary mode, except for standard output
	  and /dev/tty.  This option has no effect on POSIX-conforming systems.
	  On systems like DOS where this option makes a difference, the patch
	  should be generated by diff -a --binary.

       -c  or  --context
	  Interpret the patch file as a ordinary context diff.

       -d dir  or  --directory=dir
	  Change to the directory dir immediately, before doing anything else.

       -D define  or  --ifdef=define
	  Use the #ifdef ... #endif construct to mark changes, with define as
	  the differentiating symbol.

       --dry-run
	  Print the results of applying the patches without actually changing
	  any files.

       -e  or  --ed
	  Interpret the patch file as an ed script.

       -E  or  --remove-empty-files
	  Remove output files that are empty after the patches have been
	  applied.  Normally this option is unnecessary, since patch can examine
	  the time stamps on the header to determine whether a file should exist
	  after patching.  However, if the input is not a context diff or if
	  patch is conforming to POSIX, patch does not remove empty patched
	  files unless this option is given.  When patch removes a file, it also
	  attempts to remove any empty ancestor directories.

       -f  or  --force
	  Assume that the user knows exactly what he or she is doing, and do not
	  ask any questions.  Skip patches whose headers do not say which file
	  is to be patched; patch files even though they have the wrong version
	  for the Prereq: line in the patch; and assume that patches are not
	  reversed even if they look like they are.  This option does not
	  suppress commentary; use -s for that.

       -F num  or  --fuzz=num
	  Set the maximum fuzz factor.	This option only applies to diffs that
	  have context, and causes patch to ignore up to that many lines in
	  looking for places to install a hunk.  Note that a larger fuzz factor
	  increases the odds of a faulty patch.  The default fuzz factor is 2,
	  and it may not be set to more than the number of lines of context in
	  the context diff, ordinarily 3.

       -g num  or  --get=num
	  This option controls patch's actions when a file is under RCS or SCCS
	  control, and does not exist or is read-only and matches the default
	  version, or when a file is under ClearCase or Perforce control and
	  does not exist.  If num is positive, patch gets (or checks out) the
	  file from the revision control system; if zero, patch ignores RCS,
	  ClearCase, Perforce, and SCCS and does not get the file; and if
	  negative, patch asks the user whether to get the file.  The default
	  value of this option is given by the value of the PATCH_GET
	  environment variable if it is set; if not, the default value is zero
	  if patch is conforming to POSIX, negative otherwise.

       --help
	  Print a summary of options and exit.

       -i patchfile  or  --input=patchfile
	  Read the patch from patchfile.  If patchfile is -, read from standard
	  input, the default.

       -l  or  --ignore-whitespace
	  Match patterns loosely, in case tabs or spaces have been munged in
	  your files.  Any sequence of one or more blanks in the patch file
	  matches any sequence in the original file, and sequences of blanks at
	  the ends of lines are ignored.  Normal characters must still match
	  exactly.  Each line of the context must still match a line in the
	  original file.

       -n  or  --normal
	  Interpret the patch file as a normal diff.

       -N  or  --forward
	  Ignore patches that seem to be reversed or already applied.  See also
	  -R.

       -o outfile  or  --output=outfile
	  Send output to outfile instead of patching files in place.  Do not use
	  this option if outfile is one of the files to be patched.

       -pnum  or  --strip=num
	  Strip the smallest prefix containing num leading slashes from each
	  file name found in the patch file.  A sequence of one or more adjacent
	  slashes is counted as a single slash.  This controls how file names
	  found in the patch file are treated, in case you keep your files in a
	  different directory than the person who sent out the patch.  For
	  example, supposing the file name in the patch file was

	     /u/howard/src/blurfl/blurfl.c

	  setting -p0 gives the entire file name unmodified, -p1 gives

	     u/howard/src/blurfl/blurfl.c

	  without the leading slash, -p4 gives

	     blurfl/blurfl.c

	  and not specifying -p at all just gives you blurfl.c.  Whatever you
	  end up with is looked for either in the current directory, or the
	  directory specified by the -d option.

       --posix
	  Conform more strictly to the POSIX standard, as follows.

	   • Take the first existing file from the list (old, new, index) when
	     intuiting file names from diff headers.

	   • Do not remove files that are empty after patching.

	   • Do not ask whether to get files from RCS, ClearCase, Perforce, or
	     SCCS.

	   • Require that all options precede the files in the command line.

	   • Do not backup files when there is a mismatch.

       --quoting-style=word
	  Use style word to quote output names.  The word should be one of the
	  following:

	  literal
		 Output names as-is.

	  shell  Quote names for the shell if they contain shell metacharacters
		 or would cause ambiguous output.

	  shell-always
		 Quote names for the shell, even if they would normally not
		 require quoting.

	  c	 Quote names as for a C language string.

	  escape Quote as with c except omit the surrounding double-quote
		 characters.

	  You can specify the default value of the --quoting-style option with
	  the environment variable QUOTING_STYLE.  If that environment variable
	  is not set, the default value is shell.

       -r rejectfile  or  --reject-file=rejectfile
	  Put rejects into rejectfile instead of the default .rej file.

       -R  or  --reverse
	  Assume that this patch was created with the old and new files swapped.
	  (Yes, I'm afraid that does happen occasionally, human nature being
	  what it is.)	patch attempts to swap each hunk around before applying
	  it.  Rejects come out in the swapped format.	The -R option does not
	  work with ed diff scripts because there is too little information to
	  reconstruct the reverse operation.

	  If the first hunk of a patch fails, patch reverses the hunk to see if
	  it can be applied that way.  If it can, you are asked if you want to
	  have the -R option set.  If it can't, the patch continues to be
	  applied normally.  (Note: this method cannot detect a reversed patch
	  if it is a normal diff and if the first command is an append (i.e. it
	  should have been a delete) since appends always succeed, due to the
	  fact that a null context matches anywhere.  Luckily, most patches add
	  or change lines rather than delete them, so most reversed normal diffs
	  begin with a delete, which fails, triggering the heuristic.)

       -s  or  --silent  or  --quiet
	  Work silently, unless an error occurs.

       -t  or  --batch
	  Suppress questions like -f, but make some different assumptions: skip
	  patches whose headers do not contain file names (the same as -f); skip
	  patches for which the file has the wrong version for the Prereq: line
	  in the patch; and assume that patches are reversed if they look like
	  they are.

       -T  or  --set-time
	  Set the modification and access times of patched files from time
	  stamps given in context diff headers, assuming that the context diff
	  headers use local time.  This option is not recommended, because
	  patches using local time cannot easily be used by people in other time
	  zones, and because local time stamps are ambiguous when local clocks
	  move backwards during daylight-saving time adjustments.  Instead of
	  using this option, generate patches with UTC and use the -Z or
	  --set-utc option instead.

       -u  or  --unified
	  Interpret the patch file as a unified context diff.

       -v  or  --version
	  Print out patch's revision header and patch level, and exit.

       -V method  or  --version-control=method
	  Use method to determine backup file names.  The method can also be
	  given by the PATCH_VERSION_CONTROL (or, if that's not set, the
	  VERSION_CONTROL) environment variable, which is overridden by this
	  option.  The method does not affect whether backup files are made; it
	  affects only the names of any backup files that are made.

	  The value of method is like the GNU Emacs `version-control' variable;
	  patch also recognizes synonyms that are more descriptive.  The valid
	  values for method are (unique abbreviations are accepted):

	  existing  or	nil
	     Make numbered backups of files that already have them, otherwise
	     simple backups.  This is the default.

	  numbered  or	t
	     Make numbered backups.  The numbered backup file name for F is
	     F.~N~ where N is the version number.

	  simple  or  never
	     Make simple backups.  The -B or --prefix, -Y or --basename-prefix,
	     and -z or --suffix options specify the simple backup file name.  If
	     none of these options are given, then a simple backup suffix is
	     used; it is the value of the SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX environment
	     variable if set, and is .orig otherwise.

	  With numbered or simple backups, if the backup file name is too long,
	  the backup suffix ~ is used instead; if even appending ~ would make
	  the name too long, then ~ replaces the last character of the file
	  name.

       --verbose
	  Output extra information about the work being done.

       -x num  or  --debug=num
	  Set internal debugging flags of interest only to patch patchers.

       -Y pref	or  --basename-prefix=pref
	  Prefix pref to the basename of a file name when generating its simple
	  backup file name.  For example, with -Y .del/ the simple backup file
	  name for src/patch/util.c is src/patch/.del/util.c.

       -z suffix  or  --suffix=suffix
	  Use suffix as the simple backup suffix.  For example, with -z - the
	  simple backup file name for src/patch/util.c is src/patch/util.c-.
	  The backup suffix may also be specified by the SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX
	  environment variable, which is overridden by this option.

       -Z  or  --set-utc
	  Set the modification and access times of patched files from time
	  stamps given in context diff headers, assuming that the context diff
	  headers use Coordinated Universal Time (UTC, often known as GMT).
	  Also see the -T or --set-time option.

	  The -Z or --set-utc and -T or --set-time options normally refrain from
	  setting a file's time if the file's original time does not match the
	  time given in the patch header, or if its contents do not match the
	  patch exactly.  However, if the -f or --force option is given, the
	  file time is set regardless.

	  Due to the limitations of diff output format, these options cannot
	  update the times of files whose contents have not changed.  Also, if
	  you use these options, you should remove (e.g. with make clean) all
	  files that depend on the patched files, so that later invocations of
	  make do not get confused by the patched files' times.

ENVIRONMENT
       PATCH_GET
	  This specifies whether patch gets missing or read-only files from RCS,
	  ClearCase, Perforce, or SCCS by default; see the -g or --get option.

       POSIXLY_CORRECT
	  If set, patch conforms more strictly to the POSIX standard by default:
	  see the --posix option.

       QUOTING_STYLE
	  Default value of the --quoting-style option.

       SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX
	  Extension to use for simple backup file names instead of .orig.

       TMPDIR, TMP, TEMP
	  Directory to put temporary files in; patch uses the first environment
	  variable in this list that is set.  If none are set, the default is
	  system-dependent; it is normally /tmp on Unix hosts.

       VERSION_CONTROL or PATCH_VERSION_CONTROL
	  Selects version control style; see the -v or --version-control option.

FILES
       $TMPDIR/p∗
	  temporary files

       /dev/tty
	  controlling terminal; used to get answers to questions asked of the
	  user

NOTES FOR PATCH SENDERS
       There are several things you should bear in mind if you are going to be
       sending out patches.

       Create your patch systematically.  A good method is the command
       diff -Naur old_new where old and new identify the old and new
       directories.  The names old and new should not contain any slashes.  The
       diff command's headers should have dates and times in Universal Time
       using traditional Unix format, so that patch recipients can use the -Z or
       --set-utc option.  Here is an example command, using Bourne shell syntax:

	  LC_ALL=C TZ=UTC0 diff -Naur gcc-2.7 gcc-2.8

       Tell your recipients how to apply the patch by telling them which
       directory to cd to, and which patch options to use.  The option string
       -Np1 is recommended.  Test your procedure by pretending to be a recipient
       and applying your patch to a copy of the original files.

       You can save people a lot of grief by keeping a patchlevel.h file which
       is patched to increment the patch level as the first diff in the patch
       file you send out.  If you put a Prereq: line in with the patch, it won't
       let them apply patches out of order without some warning.

       You can create a file by sending out a diff that compares /dev/null or an
       empty file dated the Epoch (1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC) to the file you want
       to create.  This only works if the file you want to create doesn't exist
       already in the target directory.  Conversely, you can remove a file by
       sending out a context diff that compares the file to be deleted with an
       empty file dated the Epoch.  The file will be removed unless patch is
       conforming to POSIX and the -E or --remove-empty-files option is not
       given.  An easy way to generate patches that create and remove files is
       to use GNU diff's -N or --new-file option.

       If the recipient is supposed to use the -pN option, do not send output
       that looks like this:

	  diff -Naur v2.0.29/prog/README prog/README
	  --- v2.0.29/prog/README   Mon Mar 10 15:13:12 1997
	  +++ prog/README   Mon Mar 17 14:58:22 1997

       because the two file names have different numbers of slashes, and
       different versions of patch interpret the file names differently.  To
       avoid confusion, send output that looks like this instead:

	  diff -Naur v2.0.29/prog/README v2.0.30/prog/README
	  --- v2.0.29/prog/README   Mon Mar 10 15:13:12 1997
	  +++ v2.0.30/prog/README   Mon Mar 17 14:58:22 1997


       Avoid sending patches that compare backup file names like README.orig,
       since this might confuse patch into patching a backup file instead of the
       real file.  Instead, send patches that compare the same base file names
       in different directories, e.g. old/README and new/README.

       Take care not to send out reversed patches, since it makes people wonder
       whether they already applied the patch.

       Try not to have your patch modify derived files (e.g. the file configure
       where there is a line configure: configure.in in your makefile), since
       the recipient should be able to regenerate the derived files anyway.  If
       you must send diffs of derived files, generate the diffs using UTC, have
       the recipients apply the patch with the -Z or --set-utc option, and have
       them remove any unpatched files that depend on patched files (e.g. with
       make clean).

       While you may be able to get away with putting 582 diff listings into one
       file, it may be wiser to group related patches into separate files in
       case something goes haywire.

DIAGNOSTICS
       Diagnostics generally indicate that patch couldn't parse your patch file.

       If the --verbose option is given, the message Hmm... indicates that there
       is unprocessed text in the patch file and that patch is attempting to
       intuit whether there is a patch in that text and, if so, what kind of
       patch it is.

       patch's exit status is 0 if all hunks are applied successfully, 1 if some
       hunks cannot be applied, and 2 if there is more serious trouble.  When
       applying a set of patches in a loop it behooves you to check this exit
       status so you don't apply a later patch to a partially patched file.

CAVEATS
       Context diffs cannot reliably represent the creation or deletion of empty
       files, empty directories, or special files such as symbolic links.  Nor
       can they represent changes to file metadata like ownership, permissions,
       or whether one file is a hard link to another.  If changes like these are
       also required, separate instructions (e.g. a shell script) to accomplish
       them should accompany the patch.

       patch cannot tell if the line numbers are off in an ed script, and can
       detect bad line numbers in a normal diff only when it finds a change or
       deletion.  A context diff using fuzz factor 3 may have the same problem.
       Until a suitable interactive interface is added, you should probably do a
       context diff in these cases to see if the changes made sense.  Of course,
       compiling without errors is a pretty good indication that the patch
       worked, but not always.

       patch usually produces the correct results, even when it has to do a lot
       of guessing.  However, the results are guaranteed to be correct only when
       the patch is applied to exactly the same version of the file that the
       patch was generated from.

COMPATIBILITY ISSUES
       The POSIX standard specifies behavior that differs from patch's
       traditional behavior.  You should be aware of these differences if you
       must interoperate with patch versions 2.1 and earlier, which do not
       conform to POSIX.

	• In traditional patch, the -p option's operand was optional, and a bare
	  -p was equivalent to -p0.  The -p option now requires an operand, and
	  -p 0 is now equivalent to -p0.  For maximum compatibility, use options
	  like -p0 and -p1.

	  Also, traditional patch simply counted slashes when stripping path
	  prefixes; patch now counts pathname components.  That is, a sequence
	  of one or more adjacent slashes now counts as a single slash.  For
	  maximum portability, avoid sending patches containing // in file
	  names.

	• In traditional patch, backups were enabled by default.  This behavior
	  is now enabled with the -b or --backup option.

	  Conversely, in POSIX patch, backups are never made, even when there is
	  a mismatch.  In GNU patch, this behavior is enabled with the
	  --no-backup-if-mismatch option, or by conforming to POSIX with the
	  --posix option or by setting the POSIXLY_CORRECT environment variable.

	  The -b_suffix option of traditional patch is equivalent to the
	  -b -z_suffix options of GNU patch.

	• Traditional patch used a complicated (and incompletely documented)
	  method to intuit the name of the file to be patched from the patch
	  header.  This method did not conform to POSIX, and had a few gotchas.
	  Now patch uses a different, equally complicated (but better
	  documented) method that is optionally POSIX-conforming; we hope it has
	  fewer gotchas.  The two methods are compatible if the file names in
	  the context diff header and the Index: line are all identical after
	  prefix-stripping.  Your patch is normally compatible if each header's
	  file names all contain the same number of slashes.

	• When traditional patch asked the user a question, it sent the question
	  to standard error and looked for an answer from the first file in the
	  following list that was a terminal: standard error, standard output,
	  /dev/tty, and standard input.  Now patch sends questions to standard
	  output and gets answers from /dev/tty.  Defaults for some answers have
	  been changed so that patch never goes into an infinite loop when using
	  default answers.

	• Traditional patch exited with a status value that counted the number
	  of bad hunks, or with status 1 if there was real trouble.  Now patch
	  exits with status 1 if some hunks failed, or with 2 if there was real
	  trouble.

	• Limit yourself to the following options when sending instructions
	  meant to be executed by anyone running GNU patch, traditional patch,
	  or a patch that conforms to POSIX.  Spaces are significant in the
	  following list, and operands are required.

	     -c
	     -d dir
	     -D define
	     -e
	     -l
	     -n
	     -N
	     -o outfile
	     -pnum
	     -R
	     -r rejectfile

BUGS
       Please report bugs via email to &lt;bug-patch@gnu.org&gt;.

       patch could be smarter about partial matches, excessively deviant offsets
       and swapped code, but that would take an extra pass.

       If code has been duplicated (for instance with #ifdef OLDCODE ... #else
       ... #endif), patch is incapable of patching both versions, and, if it
       works at all, will likely patch the wrong one, and tell you that it
       succeeded to boot.

       If you apply a patch you've already applied, patch thinks it is a
       reversed patch, and offers to un-apply the patch.  This could be
       construed as a feature.

AUTHORS
       Larry Wall wrote the original version of patch.	Paul Eggert removed
       patch's arbitrary limits; added support for binary files, setting file
       times, and deleting files; and made it conform better to POSIX.	Other
       contributors include Wayne Davison, who added unidiff support, and David
       MacKenzie, who added configuration and backup support.
